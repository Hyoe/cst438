Git Branch Instructions

Create branch:
git checkout -b branchName

After making changes:
git add filename
git commit -m "notes of changes"
git push origin branchName

Pull from master to branch
while in branch:
git fetch
git rebase origin/master

Move from branch to master
git checkout master

Move from master to branch
git checkout branchName

Get rid of changes you made that have not been commited--
git checkout -- . 

While working in someone else's branch
create a new branch git checkout -b (someBranchName)
then same procedure git add filename
git commit
git push
